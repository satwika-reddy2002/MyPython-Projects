This repository showcases my ongoing journey learning Python, from the basics to more advanced concepts. Over the years, I have continuously built and expanded my skills.

I began with the excellent Udemy course The Complete Python Bootcamp by Angela Yu, which helped me perfect my understanding of Python fundamentals, architectures, APIs, and more.

Through consistent practice, I have also mastered various Python libraries like Pandas,Numpy etc, that are essential for real-world applications, and I continue to explore and enhance my expertise.
